# EASY LSTM

Dealing with simple LSTM models can be a real pain, due to the excessive ammount of preprocessing required.
This model takes very few inputs, among them, a function that returns model during the initialization, the hyperparameters to fit the model, and it'll return the output as a DataFrame.
This class only works as single-input to single-output and multiple-output to multiple-out. To work with multiple-input to single-output it should be tweaked.
